The world's magical nature stems from this celestial origin.\n\n### The Age of Titans (Before Time)\n\nFor millennia, elemental titans ruled the planet, shaping its mountains, oceans, and skies. Their conflicts created the magical leylines that crisscross the planet's surface.\n\n**Key Titans:**\n- **Terros** - The Mountain Father\n- **Aquara** - The Endless Deep\n- **Pyros** - The Eternal Flame\n- **Zephyra** - The Storm Mother\n\n### The Mortal Dawn (Year 0)\n\nThe first mortal races emerged from the titans' experiments:\n- **Elves** - Born from starlight and Lunara's tears\n- **Dwarves** - Carved from living stone by Terros\n- **Humans** - Shaped from clay and given the spark of all elements\n- **Dragonborn** - Children of Pyros's breath\n- **Others** - From various elemental forces\n\n### The First Age (0-2000)\n\nMortal civilizations spread across Aetheria.
